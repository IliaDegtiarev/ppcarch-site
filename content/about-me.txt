The Thrust Behind Your Growth
“Your business is the rocket. I provide the thrust.”  
I specialize in helping Amazon sellers optimize ad spend, increase ROI, 
and tackle complex PPC challenges. My approach is data-driven and 
results-focused, ensuring each strategy is tailored to your brand’s unique needs.

Frequently Asked Questions
How can you help me reduce my ACoS without sacrificing sales?
I optimize both ACoS and TACoS, ensuring you don’t lose 
impressions for critical keywords. By analyzing product 
lifecycle stages and shifting spend to high-margin products, 
I maintain growth while reducing wasted ad spend.

How do you improve ROAS?
I prioritize high-performing campaigns (top 20%) with 
strategic allocation. This approach focuses on efficiency, 
while also testing new placements and ad formats for 
incremental gains.
